## 🚆 About

Create: Transit Tickets adds reusable ticket blueprints, issued transit tickets, and working ticket gates for public transportation systems built with the **Create** mod.

Ticket blueprints are configured through an in-game menu—commands are no longer required for normal use. A blueprint stores a custom name, usage type, and transit service.

- 🎫 **Single Use** tickets allow one gate passage.
- 🔢 **Multiple Use** tickets allow a configurable number of passages.
- ⏳ **Limited Time** tickets remain valid for a configurable duration.
- ♾️ **Unlimited Time** tickets never expire.

Tickets can use the **Local**, **Semi-Fast**, or **Express** service. Operators can configure each gate to accept any service or require one specific service.

The Blank Ticket, Ticket Blueprint, Transit Ticket, and Ticket Gate use Create-style tooltips. Hold Shift while hovering to see their summaries and usage instructions. The Incomplete Transit Ticket is currently a simple intermediate item.

---

## ✨ Current Version Highlights

The current `0.1.3-beta` release includes:

- 🚂 Support for **Create 6.0.8** on Minecraft 1.20.1.
- 📝 An in-game Ticket Blueprint configuration menu with name, type, service, passage, and duration controls.
- 🎫 Single Use, Multiple Use, Limited Time, and Unlimited Time ticket types.
- 🚉 Local, Semi-Fast, and Express ticket services.
- 🔧 Per-gate service requirements configured by operators with Create's Wrench.
- 📦 Operator-only wrench dismantling that returns the Ticket Gate item.
- 🚶 Gates that close after a player passes through or after a hard five-second timeout.
- 🛡️ Server-validated configuration packets for blueprints and gates.
- 📖 Create-style Shift summaries for the Blank Ticket, Ticket Blueprint, Transit Ticket, and Ticket Gate.
- ⚙️ Ticket production using a Deployer followed by a Mechanical Press.

## 🎫 Ticket Workflow

> 📄 **Blank Ticket** + 📝 **Ticket Blueprint** → ⚙️ **Deployer** → 🟨 **Incomplete Transit Ticket** → 🔨 **Mechanical Press** → 🎟️ **Valid Transit Ticket** → 🚧 **Ticket Gate**

### ⚙️ Creating a Valid Ticket with Create Machinery

1. Craft a **Blank Ticket** and a **Ticket Blueprint**.
2. Hold the Ticket Blueprint and right-click to open its configuration menu.
3. Choose the ticket name, type, service, and any required duration or passage count, then select **Done**.
4. Place the configured Ticket Blueprint into the hand of a **Deployer**. The Deployer must be powered and positioned over a belt, depot, or other valid processing surface.
5. Send a Blank Ticket underneath the Deployer. It deploys the blueprint onto the blank and produces an **Incomplete Transit Ticket**. The blueprint remains in the Deployer and can be reused.
6. Send the Incomplete Transit Ticket beneath a powered **Mechanical Press**.
7. The press produces an issued **Transit Ticket** containing the blueprint's configured name, type, service, and validity data.
8. Hold the finished ticket and use it on a compatible **Ticket Gate**.

The ticket becomes valid when the Mechanical Press finishes. For Limited Time tickets, the validity period begins at that moment. Removing an Incomplete Transit Ticket before pressing it does not issue or activate it.

> Incomplete Transit Tickets made by older builds before NBT transfer was added do not contain blueprint settings. Deploy a new Blank Ticket after updating if an existing intermediate produces an invalid ticket.

### 📄 Blank Ticket

- The material consumed when a Ticket Blueprint is deployed onto it.
- Contains no validity or expiration data by itself.
- Two sheets of paper craft four blank tickets.
- Hold Shift while hovering to display its Create-style summary.

### 📝 Ticket Blueprint

- A reusable template applied to Blank Tickets by a Deployer.
- Right-click it to open its configuration menu.
- Stores the ticket name, usage type, service, and any required passage or duration value.
- The service selector supports **Local**, **Semi-Fast**, and **Express**.
- **Multiple Use** displays a passage-count field.
- **Limited Time** displays a duration field. Supported suffixes are `t` (ticks), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), and `d` (Minecraft days).
- One second equals 20 ticks, and one Minecraft day equals 24,000 ticks.
- **Single Use** and **Unlimited Time** require no additional value.
- Hold Shift while hovering to display its Create-style summary and usage instructions.

### 🟨 Incomplete Transit Ticket

- Produced when a Deployer applies a configured Ticket Blueprint to a Blank Ticket.
- Stores a copy of the blueprint settings while moving between machines.
- Is not issued and cannot open a Ticket Gate.
- Must be processed by a Mechanical Press to become a valid Transit Ticket.
- Currently uses the Blank Ticket texture as a temporary model.

### 🎟️ Transit Ticket

- Uses the name configured on its blueprint.
- Retains the type and service configured on its blueprint.
- A Limited Time ticket stores its issue time, duration, and expiration time using the world's game time.
- Single Use and Multiple Use tickets store their original and remaining passage counts.
- An Unlimited Time ticket does not expire.
- Clearly displays **Valid**, **Expired**, or **Used Up** in the tooltip.
- Hold Shift while hovering to display its Create-style summary.

## 💻 Blueprint Commands (Optional)

The in-game blueprint menu is the recommended configuration method. Legacy helper commands remain available to Creative players and command sources with permission level 2 or higher.

> Command-created blueprints use the Local service and cover the legacy limited-time and passage-limited formats. Use the in-game menu for all four ticket types and all service choices.

### ⏳ Time-limited tickets

```text
/transittickets blueprint <duration_ticks> [name]
```

`duration_ticks` must be at least `1`. The optional name may contain spaces and is limited to 64 characters. If no name is supplied, the ticket is named `Transit Ticket`.

For example, a 30-minute ticket lasts 36,000 ticks:

```text
/transittickets blueprint 36000 30 Minute Pass
```

Minecraft normally runs at 20 ticks per second. Ticket time advances with the world's game time and pauses when the world is not running.

### 🔢 Passage-limited tickets

```text
/transittickets blueprint passages <count> [name]
```

`count` must be at least `1`. Each successful validation at a ticket gate consumes one passage immediately.

Examples:

```text
/transittickets blueprint passages 1 Single Ride
/transittickets blueprint passages 5 Five Ride Pass
```

## 🚧 Ticket Gate Behavior

- Use the gate while holding an issued, valid **Transit Ticket**.
- Gates accept **Any Service** by default.
- An operator can right-click a placed gate with Create's Wrench to require **Local**, **Semi-Fast**, or **Express** service instead.
- Gate configuration is restricted to operators with permission level 2 or higher.
- An operator can sneak and right-click with Create's Wrench to dismantle the gate and drop its item.
- A valid ticket plays an acceptance sound and opens the center barrier.
- A valid ticket with the wrong service is rejected without consuming a passage.
- Passage-limited tickets lose one passage as soon as the gate accepts them. At zero passages, the ticket becomes **Used Up** and cannot open another gate.
- Limited Time tickets can open gates repeatedly until their world-time expiration. Unlimited Time tickets never expire.
- The gate closes after the player passes through and leaves the gate block.
- The gate always closes after 100 ticks (about five seconds), even if a player remains inside it.
- An empty hand, an unissued ticket, an expired ticket, a used-up ticket, or any other item is rejected with a denial sound and an on-screen error message.
- Hold Shift while hovering over the gate item to display its Create-style summary and wrench instructions.
